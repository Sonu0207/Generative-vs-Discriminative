# *Assignment 2 - Generative vs. Discriminative Models*
In this assignment, we evaluate the performance of Naive Bayes (a Generative Model) and Logistic Regression (a Discriminative Model) in classifying two penguin species.
The evaluation focuses on accuracy, AUC (Area Under the ROC Curve), and Lift/Gain charts to determine which model distinguishes between the species more effectively. 
The analysis is extended to a more complex dataset, such as MNIST, to explore how these models perform on image data compared to the penguin dataset. 
Finally, the overall performance of both models is compared, providing insights into which one is more effective.
